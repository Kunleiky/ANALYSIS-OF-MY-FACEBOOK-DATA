Napoleon Bonaparte had a knack for remembering his soldiers' names and that earned him more respect among the army. \nI remembered earlier this year when I met a friend after a long time. She has a friend and they are always together. I knew the names of both of them. When I saw them I greeted her. Hey, Olufunmi Abiola Brown how are you? Been a while. Then it was time for me to acknowledge her friend. I wanted to call her name, and guess what? I went blank. Then I courteously asked. Could you please remind me of your name? She replied: Wow you remembered my friend's full name? Full name, and you didn't remember mine. I'm not telling you. I felt bad. So I promised myself I was going to remember her full name next time which I did.\nPeople's names sounds sweet to their hearings and it shows you're thoughtful!"

I remember some students telling me jokingly not to walk alone so that they will not kidnap me, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certain that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d won.\nStudents were gathered together on the assembly ground eagerly waiting for the outcome of the poll, when suddenly it was announced that the winners will no longer be announced that soon, and that the students should go back to their respective classes. \nIt was my principal that gave the order to disperse the assembly. She obviously was still skeptical about my ability to control the students. I understood her fear, it was a public school where we had scores of students who were extremely stubborn and crude in manners. Our set came up in the wake of the era when students come to school with weapons such as the legendary \u00e2\u0080\u009cLebe\u00e2\u0080\u009d because inter-school feud was common then. That was minimal in our set, but we still had students who were unruly.\nIt was during the first term in SS3 that they officially announced our respective posts. My joy knew no bounds when I was called upon last and decorated with the badge of the head boy. I remembered Sapele Otega and a friend of his bearing me shoulder high to the assembly platform. \nLooking back, I learnt from that memory that if you should do something, do it, even if the odds are against you."

The election was overseen by Mr Jaiyeola, an intelligent science teacher who likes me a lot and must have defended me at the presence of the principal several times. He never doubted my ability and charisma. He'd  earlier had a meeting with the 120 of us that were selected as acting prefects. During the meeting, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d asked us, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho among you thinks he can be the head boy of this school?\u00e2\u0080\u009d There was a pregnant silence in the hall. Again he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you think you can be the head boy of this school, stand up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I moved unnoticeably to the edge of my seat, and in that instant I felt a hand touching me from behind, and someone telling me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cStand up, you can do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was Sunday Okegbola. I stood up, looked behind me(I was seated at the front), and saw one more person on his feet. It was Ademola. Mr Jaiyeola then decided to make me the supervisor, and asked Ademola to be my assistant.\nOn the day of our manifesto declarations, I overheard a female colleague from art class saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIbikunle will not become our head boy, I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like him,  I can even say it to his face.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She was at the entrance of the class we used for the manifesto declarations, and when we came out from the class. She hit my chest gently and rhythmically, muttering \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will not be our head boy\u00e2\u0080\u009d. I just smiled and went away with crowd of supporters behind me. I remember some of the students saying don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind her, you will be our head boy."

I walked away gloomily. I knew her well enough to understand she meant what she had said. She had a no-nonsense personality, only few students including me and Sapele Otega, who was quite influential and was supposedly her church member had the luxury of entering her office for one reason or the other."

Everybody started running helter-skelter. The situation was compounded by the fear of the d\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0 vu of the 1999 gory incident. A student even jumped down on the concrete hallway from the Upper Buttery about 9 feet high, badly injuring himself. Distracted by the bag I left where I sat earlier, I totally forgot I was with someone. I went for the bag and then joined the stampede. Few seconds later, I came back to my senses and head back towards the Cafe to look for Lewa. Fortunately for me, I saw her seeking refuge behind the photocopiers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 stands at the Cafe. So I took her hand, and accompanied her towards her hostel until we were both sure it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe for her to walk down alone to the hostel. Moment later, I felt like oh thank goodness I saw  Lewa when I returned to look for her. She might have told me, \u00e2\u0080\u009c see you, you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even protect me and you want to date me\u00e2\u0080\u009d."

        "post": "Campus Reminiscence 1\n\n I was heading back to my hostel from Academics as usual. So on getting to Awo Hall, I decided to enter Awo Cafe to catch some chills. I sat on a chair, then dropped my bag on the reading table. In that instant I sighted Lewa my friend and crush on one of the chairs far away from mine, studying. Leaving my bag, I went close and took my seat beside her. We began to chat as usual. At the same time, the politikoko guys were deliberating on hot campus political matters. The whole place was uncontrollably boisterous. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099d started their deliberations even before I came around, but I was not too surprised Lewa could cope with such hell of a noise. \nThat is the nature of Awo Cafe. It is a market place, where students face what ever they came to buy or sell. Some students may be reading at a section of the Cafe, while some others chit-chat at another section. It is not uncommon to see clownish students make their way into the Cafe and suddenly throw jibes that left some students distracted and some others indifferent. Some handshakes and laughter among friends were just loud enough to attract the attention of every living being present at that moment.\nOn this particular night, the atmosphere was tense in the Cafe. The vociferation was unbearable, so only few students were reading there. There was a dissension among the student union leaders, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d chosen Awo Cafe as the ground for flexing their muscles. The argument among them was gaining momentum until it reached a fearsome crescendo."

        "post": "CHILDHOOD REMINISCENCE 1\n\nOn a particular day in the year 2006, then still in the junior secondary school, I offended my mother, so she threatened not to give me pocket money for school that day until I do what she had asked me to do. So, I decided to \u00e2\u0080\u0098punish\u00e2\u0080\u0099 her, with the sheer ignorance of the fact that I was doing myself a disfavour. For the first and last time in my life I played truancy. Unfortunately for me, our neighbour who was going out saw me at the time of the day no serious students should be seen gallivanting around, and reported me at home. Worse still, I got home earlier than I should that day\u00e2\u0080\u0094I miscalculated the closing time, because I was feeling either homesick or schoolsick already. Before I got home, the storm was already waiting for me, ready to break. \n On getting home, they went through my books and saw that the latest date on my notes was the date of a day two weeks back. My mother and our neighbours began to tongue-lash me. In that instant, one of my land lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sons who is known to be a disciplinarian asked me to start smoking Monkey Cigarette (that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a kind of punishment), and then went inside to take his belt in order to give me the beating of my life.\n I was an ardent football fan, and it was during the 2006 FIFA World Cup hosted by Germany.  As I was observing the punishment, I remembered Brazil will be playing Japan that day and once he beat me I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to go out and watch the match, as that would further confirm my stubbornness and lack of seriousness to everybody around. I saw him through the window as he was coming outside from his room with a black belt in his hand. In that instant, barefooted, I whizzed out of the compound, and ran away in the presence of everyone around, then went to a viewing centre located streets away from our house to enjoy the match. They were looking for me all day around the vicinity. I returned home only when it was dark, so nobody was talking about scolding me again. I was served a delicious meal. I remembered my land lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son vowing not to ever intervene in my issues again. \nDays later I was with this my land lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son in his room. Being an ardent football fan himself, we were both watching our Super Falcons players being granted an interview ahead of a tournament. Then suddenly he turned to me and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009dThe other day, you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get to school, I wanted to chastise you; you ran away. Look at those female footballers on the television right now, they are speaking correct English\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re impressed right? If eventually you become a footballer, they interview you, and  can't  speak correct English, what becomes of you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nFrom that day onward, I decided to turn a new leaf, and looking back all the years, I was glad I did turn that new leaf."

        "post": "The Rest Room and the Million Naira Idea\n\nIdeas, it is said rule the world. Large establishments today began as lean startups and each lean startup began as a single idea. Many thoughts and ideas flicker in our minds every day, but we hardly pay attention to them. These thoughts have a short life span, this is because human mind according to sages is like a monkey that hops freely from one tree to another. More than 600 thoughts cross our minds daily. We think without thinking! According to John C. Maxwell, ideas have a short shelf life. \nIdeas come to us just anywhere at any time, and the rest room is not an exception. I know someone who starts singing just immediately she enters the shower. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s simply because inspiration flows to her right there. A colleague jokingly told us once that during exam times, he takes his jotters and key points with him into the rest room; he said he assimilates there better. That sounds awkward to some people, but the fact is, the rest room is a place where numerous ideas flow to people. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a place where people think about things they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have otherwise thought about elsewhere. Some learners also assimilate better there.\nI personally do wonder also why inspirations flow to people in the rest room, until I heard Pastor Segun Obadje, the G.O. of God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Love Tabernacle, Ile Ife spoke extensively about relaxation and recreation. He said we think better, and inspirations flow to us in the rest room because we are better relaxed there, and we have only one business in there\u00e2\u0080\u0094 to get the shit out! When we are in the rest room, we are shut out from the buzz of quotidian activities, making us to think undisturbed.  \nPaying attention to even the slightest ideas that occur to you is tantamount to making headway into something tangible and rewarding, and leveraging on opportunities. So, when else you enter the rest room and an idea whirls into your head, document it because it might just be a million Naira idea that will shoot you out of obscurity and into stardom.\n\u00c2\u00a9IBK"

Although, not until ASUU completed a six-month strike were we called upon to resume as freshers.Upon resumption, we began to do the necessary registrations- faculty registration, departmental registration health centre registration and so on. \nFew days after the necessary registrations, lectures began. As a freshman, I couldn't wait to receive my first lecture- the first lecture we had was on History of Accounting in Acc 101 which was taught by Dr. Mrs Salawu at Law 209. After the lecture that evening, I trudge to my hostel alongside a coursemate, relishing the joy of being an undergraduate. \n                            My Days In Awo Hall\nThrough out my undergraduate days, I stayed in Awo Hall. Awo Hall is the most popular hall on OAU campus. Its nickname is \"castle of great men\". Some students refer to it as the capital of OAU. The hall is always a lively place, especially in the evening. The Awo Boyz All-Star never failed to entertain the students with their \"Aro\"; the political-conscious students did gather beside the notice board at the lower buttery to discuss political issues. Those were the days of Comrade Engels, Ibikunle, who was the students' union president in my part one days, Comrade Juwon, Levuz, Hon.Bright, Ojogbon, Olori, Comrade Azaro, Binzu,  Honourable TY,who later became the students'union president, Immanuel Kant, Hon.IBk. Also some students made funny sounds all around the hostel like barking, bleating, mewing, and crowing, to make people laugh.\nOur room was often boisterous with guys arguing about sport, music, academics, politics, the opposite sex and many more. On many occasions, guys from other rooms came to our room to engage us in conversations about different topics. It's difficult to concentrate on reading in the room. If you wanted to read, you would have to pack your books and go to Awo Cafe, Upper Reading Room or better still Academics. In spite of the noise, I sometimes read in the room and my room mates would wonder how I was able to concentrate, but it's a condition I've got myself used to.\nIn my part one days an amazing incident happened in our room, which still amuses me to this day. It was around 2 a.m. and we were all asleep except for Alfa Shina who was washing his cloth downstairs. The whole drama began when Taiwo Suddenly sprang to his feet as if something had hit or a creature had bitten him. Quadri and Segun who slept beside him also woke up in that instant; the three of them headed for the door but before they got to the door, Modupe(Wandy) who had jumped down from his upper bunk was already there standing still.At that moment also, every other person including me was running  towards the door. I woke up when Daniel stamped on my feet while trying to make off. I was shouting: \"Blood of Jesus!\", \"Blood of Jesus!!\". If not for Modupe, a chubby guy who stood by the door motionless, Taiwo or Quadri would have succeeded in opening the door and some of us would have jumped down from our floor- the second floor- or probably rushed down through the staircase.\nSoon after, we all came back to our senses and realised that there was no danger around; we didn't see any sign of fire, no strange movement or sound to make us think a snake had crept in, we asked Taiwo what he saw that made him spring to his feet in the first place, and he couldn't say anything. We laughed at ourselves for several days on this incident. \n                                     The Challenges\nAnybody would agree to the fact that life in OAU  can be stressful. As an undergraduate, there were several challenges that came my way. After long hours of classes and tutorials, I have to still read (who wants to fail?). I refer to myself as a business student. Because even as a student, I have my own tutorial centre, I compiled past questions and solutions  on two courses, and most times I take private tutorials. Time is always a constraint. Lecturers will bombard you with materials on their respective courses.  I move from hostel to academics on average of four times in a day. During the time of political activities, close pals of mine going for the same post will walk up to me. \"Ibk, I'm going for this, I'm going for that. \" You have to decide on who to support. During breaks,  they will ask at home: \"Who is the picture perfect? \" \n                  Comics In The Midst Of Academic Rigours\nIn spite of all the academic rigours students face on campus, we would always have one or two things that amuse us students. In Awo Hall, we were often entertained by the Aro performance. Some hilarious guys could just enter into Awo Cafe and started throwing jibes at the students \"jacking\" there. On OAU campus, you may be referred to by your friends and course mates as \"Shana\" or \"Iwe Ogba\" even when you are still struggling with a course. On several occasions , I'd been to Academics to read, but found it difficult to concentrate, yet when coming back, my course mates I met on the way would still call me Iwe Ogba.\n                         My Involvement In Political Activities\nOn gaining admission, I went to the secondary school I attended to break the news of my admission to my teachers, being a well recognised student in the school. One of them told me:\n\"Ibikunle, when you get to campus, don't join politics. Campus politics is bloody o, and don't join them in doing  any aluta o. You know you are tall, they can easily spot you.\"\nSincerely, I was glad OAU politics is not bloody compared to what I've heard about some other schools. I've joined the aluta train right from my day one on campus. I doff my cap for the comrades who fought frantically with their sweat and blood for the peace which OAU students now enjoy. Kudos to the comrades who from time to time defend the rights and interests of students. I have a lot of respect for these guys. \nI wanted to contest for the post of an honourable at the students' union level in my part 2 days, but as fate would have it, the students'union was suspended by the powers that be. In  my penultimate year, I contested for the post of the president in my department, but the best candidate won. My involvement in politics made me meet so many greatness-bound comrades who will forever be in my memory. I also learnt so many lessons politics has in stock to teach its students. I'm glad to have contributed my quota to the redefinition of the campus political terrain. \n                           The wonderful people I Met\nIn our sojourn in life, we'll come across many people God has chosen to be our companions as we journey on. I must not fail to mention the wonderful personalities I met in my short spell on this campus. Let me start from my wonderful lecturers like Mr. Quadri Lawal, a.k.a. Resolution whom I refer to as 'simple Resolution'(He has the most stupendous personality traits anyone can emulate or desire), Mr. Siyanbade a.k.a. I Can, Dr Monday, Dr. Olasanmi and other lecturers who've had significant impact in my life and career. \nI'll always relish the day I met Falade Adenike, an awesome companion anyone will dream of befriending. Olowu Oladipupo, you're a true friend. Tofunmi, you're a wonderful lady, Abiola, you're awesome, Wahab Akeem a.k.a. Highcomm, you're a rare gem. Omaka Kingsley, you're not just a friend, but also a mentor. I also appreciate The Cognoscentis, Olajide Oreoluwa a.k.a Pretty Priya, Oshun Adebola, Idowu Deborah, Taiwo, Kemi Helen, Esther, Bewaji Omolewa, Akerele Isaac, Emmanuel a.k.a.

I'm confident to say I'm a product of sound formal and self education.

Although, not until ASUU completed a six-month strike were we called upon to resume as freshers.Upon resumption, we began to do the necessary registrations- faculty registration, departmental registration health centre registration and so on. \nFew days after the necessary registrations, lectures began. As a freshman, I couldn't wait to receive my first lecture- the first lecture we had was on History of Accounting in Acc 101 which was taught by Dr. Mrs Salawu at Law 209. After the lecture that evening, I trudge to my hostel alongside a coursemate, relishing the joy of being an undergraduate. \n                            My Days In Awo Hall\nThrough out my undergraduate days, I stayed in Awo Hall. Awo Hall is the most popular hall on OAU campus. Its nickname is \"castle of great men\". Some students refer to it as the capital of OAU. The hall is always a lively place, especially in the evening. The Awo Boyz All-Star never failed to entertain the students with their \"Aro\"; the political-conscious students did gather beside the notice board at the lower buttery to discuss political issues. Those were the days of Comrade Engels, Ibikunle, who was the students' union president in my part one days, Comrade Juwon, Levuz, Hon.Bright, Ojogbon, Olori, Comrade Azaro, Binzu,  Honourable TY,who later became the students'union president, Immanuel Kant, Hon.IBk. Also some students made funny sounds all around the hostel like barking, bleating, mewing, and crowing, to make people laugh.\nOur room was often boisterous with guys arguing about sport, music, academics, politics, the opposite sex and many more. On many occasions, guys from other rooms came to our room to engage us in conversations about different topics. It's difficult to concentrate on reading in the room. If you wanted to read, you would have to pack your books and go to Awo Cafe, Upper Reading Room or better still Academics. In spite of the noise, I sometimes read in the room and my room mates would wonder how I was able to concentrate, but it's a condition I've got myself used to.\nIn my part one days an amazing incident happened in our room, which still amuses me to this day. It was around 2 a.m. and we were all asleep except for Alfa Shina who was washing his cloth downstairs. The whole drama began when Taiwo Suddenly sprang to his feet as if something had hit or a creature had bitten him. Quadri and Segun who slept beside him also woke up in that instant; the three of them headed for the door but before they got to the door, Modupe(Wandy) who had jumped down from his upper bunk was already there standing still.At that moment also, every other person including me was running  towards the door.
